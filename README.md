# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

I started this project as a way to increase my knowledge about graph algorithms and was inspired by how others approached this idea. I used the react framework to leverage the latest UI and frontend properties to show these awesome algorithms in action. Check it out using the [link here](https://nikky-soriano.github.io/pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer/) and use Google Chrome on a PC Browser to get the best experience!

## Pathfinding Algorithms:

1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A\* Algorithm
3. Greedy Best First Search
4. Bidirectional Greedy Search
5. Breadth First Search
6. Depth First Search
7. Random Walk

## Maze Generation Algorithms:

1. Random Maze
2. Recursive Division Maze
